What is Saffroncoin?
------------------

Saffron coin is a saffron-backed digital currency, and we intend to exchange saffron for saffron coin, which makes it a common currency in everyday transactions.
The use of blockchain technology in sending saffron can improve the performance of this supply chain in turn, and improving the transparency and ensuring the performance of the producer is one of the goals of using this technology.

The main way to use blockchain in business is to use it in the saffron supply chain for the consumer.

Blockchain technology helps food suppliers to improve the way saffron is sent and received worldwide."
